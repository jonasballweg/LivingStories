# Living Stories Overview

Imagine you learn a new language not just by learning words and solving some exercises, but by diving into a language \- with an app that rethinks language learning. You can experience the language through interactive stories and role-plays. Suppose you want to learn Japanese: You are reading a text and suddenly you find yourself in the mountains of Japan where you have to convince a guard to let you into a village. You are not just a passive reader any more but you have to actively engage with different characters to make progress. Every sentence is adapted to your level of language ability. 

## Why (Purpose/Motivation): 

The app exists to revolutionize language learning by moving beyond passive reading and repetitive exercises. Its purpose is to create an immersive and engaging learning experience, allowing users to interact in real-world scenarios where they actively engage with the language. The motivation is to make language learning more dynamic, memorable, and effective through story-based, role-playing interactions, making learners feel like they are actually living in the language environment.

## How (Process/Approach): 

The app achieves this by using AI (GPT-4) to generate interactive stories where users can take part in dialogues and make choices that influence the story's progression. This active learning process helps the user practice the language in context, reinforcing vocabulary and grammar through practical usage, making learning engaging and personalized. The app integrates real-world scenarios where learners must think and respond in the target language, giving them immediate, context-based feedback.

## What (The Result/Product): 

Organic (this includes a new level of personalization) & Context Learning \- Our brain doesn’t just learn a language by trying to remember words. First, it starts by understanding a word (i.e. by hearing it). Then, we learn how to read it. Then, we learn how that word is used in context and we understand it in different contexts. Only after that we learn how to use (speak, write) a word, i.e. once we start to apply a new word, we have already seen it a lot of times which makes it much easier to remember.  
Context can be visual, verbal or acoustic. It is interactive\!
